I will create my first project: Recipes

I will demonstrate that iá¸¿ capable of using HTML language by creating a webpage.

First i will set the doctype
Second the head - Selecting english language and the charset
Third, the body
    Working with paragraphs and headers (6 sizes)
    With strong, the words will get bold, and with em they will become italyc
    I can create a element, to create hyperlinks, to other webpages or pages on my own webpage
    Also, i can insert images, with img
    I will include lists, ordered or unordered list (each element l1, l2, etc...)

Every HTML tag must be opened and closed
